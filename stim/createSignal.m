function signal = createSignal(frequency, amplitude, on_duration, off_duration, reps)
% Function creating the signal for the experiments. This signal is
% subsequently used to generate a stimulation matrix. It requires the
% following parameters:
% - frequency = vibrational frequency of the stimulus
% - amplitude = amplitude of the stimulus
% - on_duration = time the stimulation is on
% - off_duration = time the stimulation is off. A continuous stimulus means
%                   off_duration = 0. 
% - reps = how many times the on/off duration should be repeated. As an
%           example, if you want a stimulus of 4 seconds where the stimulus
%           is on for .4s and off for .1s you need reps = 8.
